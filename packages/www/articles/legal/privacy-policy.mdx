5. **Additional Disclosures Specific to the CCPA**
This part specifies our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing Personal Information as governed by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
{`  `}5.1. **Categories of Personal Information Collected and Disclosed**
{`    `}The Personal Information that we collect, or have collected, from consumers or other third parties in the twelve months prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy fall into the following categories established by the CCPA. The specific categories depend on the services you use or purchase or your interaction with our webpages, etc. Below, we outline how we use and disclose these categories of Personal Information. Please note, the second column provides examples of these uses. For comprehensive details on our use of your Personal Information, please refer to the "How We Use Personal Information" section in the Privacy Policy.
    | Category of Personal Information | Examples of How We Use the Category of Personal Information | Sources of the Personal Information Collected | Categories of Third Parties That Personal Information is Disclosed to |

    | Geolocation data | To improve our Services and conduct research | Directly from You | Google Analytics, Posthog |
{`  `}5.2. **No Sale of Personal Information**
{`    `}The CCPA sets forth specific responsibilities for businesses regarding the "sale" or "sharing" of Personal Information with third parties for cross-contextual behavioral advertising. 
{`    `}In accordance with the CCPA and based on current regulatory guidance, we do not “sell” or “share” Personal Information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising in the past 12 months prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy.
{`    `}California residents are entitled to opt out of the "sale" or "sharing" of their Personal Information for such advertising purposes under the CCPA. However, our practices do not involve these activities. If our practices change, we will update this Privacy Policy and take any necessary action to comply with applicable law.
{`  `}5.3. **Your Rights**
{`    `}You may have certain rights under the CCPA. These rights are subject to certain conditions and exceptions. Your rights under the CCPA may include the following:
{`    `}5.3.1. **Right to Know**
{`    `}  You have the right to request information about our Personal Information processing activities during the past 12 months, including: (i) the categories of Personal Information we collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information about you; (iii) the categories of third parties to which we disclosed Personal Information for a business purpose; (iv) the categories of Personal Information we disclosed about you for a business purpose; (v) our business or commercial purpose for collecting your Personal Information; and (vi) the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you. 
{`    `}  You are entitled to make this request for information twice within a 12-month period, at no cost. Should we be unable to fulfill your request, we will provide you with the corresponding reasons. It's important to note that in responding to a request for information, we are restricted from revealing certain types of Personal Information, such as your driver’s license number or other government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, account passwords, security questions and answers, and unique biometric data derived from human characteristics.
{`    `}5.3.2. **Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information**
{`    `}  You may be entitled to request the deletion of your Personal Information that we have collected. You can submit the deletion request via the following path in the Services: “My”-“Account Management”-“Cancel Account”. However, there are instances where we might not be able to honor your request, particularly if retaining your Personal Information is required for us to fulfill legal obligations or to complete a transaction for which the information was initially collected. Should we be unable to proceed with your deletion request, we will provide you with an explanation for our decision. 
{`    `}  Upon accepting your deletion instruction, we will delete or de-identify your information or, if immediate deletion is not feasible (for example, because the data is preserved within secured backup archives), we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until it can be safely deleted.
{`    `}5.3.3. **Right to Non-Discrimination**
{`    `}  Should you decide to exercise any of your rights, rest assured that we will treat you with the utmost fairness and respect. Under no circumstances will we subject you to any form of discrimination because of your decision to assert your rights. 
{`  `}5.4. **How we verify requests and respond to requests?**
{`    `}To protect your Personal Information, our process for responding to consumer requests involves a thorough verification of identity. Upon receipt of a request, we immediately take steps to confirm that the individual making the request is indeed who they claim to be or has the authority to act on someone else's behalf. This involves requesting additional information to help us verify your identity.
{`    `}During the verification process, we may contact you to provide specific information that matches the details we already have on record. The level of verification required—whether a reasonable degree of certainty or a high degree of certainty—depends on the nature of your request.
{`    `}This could mean matching two or three pieces of information we hold about you with the information you provide. In certain instances, we may also require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury, affirming that you are the consumer whose personal information is being requested.
{`    `}It's important to provide us with sufficient information so we can understand, evaluate, and respond to your request effectively. Without being able to confirm that the personal information relates to you, we are unable to proceed with your request or provide any personal information. The information provided in a verifiable consumer request is used exclusively for the purposes of verifying your identity, processing your request, and locating the relevant information.
{`    `}For those using an authorized agent to submit a request, we will verify the identity of both you and your agent. We may ask for a signed document confirming the agent's authorization to act on your behalf. To safeguard your personal information, we reserve the right to deny requests from agents who cannot provide proof of authorization.
{`    `}Please note, there are circumstances where we are unable to delete personal information, such as when retention is necessary for our internal business purposes or as required by the CCPA for reasons like fraud prevention or legal compliance. In these cases, we will retain your information in line with our records retention program and securely delete it at the end of the retention period.
{`  `}5.5. **Response timing and format**
{`    `}We make every attempt to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. Should we need additional time, we'll notify you promptly. Upon receipt of your request, we will deliver our written response by replying to your email. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. When you request a copy of your Personal Information, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity easily.
{`    `}We generally do not impose fees for processing or responding to your verifiable consumer request unless it is deemed excessive, repetitive, or clearly unfounded. In cases where a fee may be applicable, we will explain the reasons and provide a cost estimate before proceeding with your request.
{`    `}Please be aware that your choices regarding your rights may affect the availability or provision of certain services.

{`6.`} **Children**

How long we retain Personal Information will depend on a number of factors, such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, any legal requirements, and our purpose for processing the information.
