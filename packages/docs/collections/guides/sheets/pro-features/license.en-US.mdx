# License

## Overview

Full Univer Pro Features require license support. You can activate paid plans by adding a license to your project, or you can upgrade to a higher-level plan by updating your license. This page will guide you on how to obtain, configure, and verify licenses.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you:
- Have integrated Univer Pro Features in your project. If you haven't completed the integration, please refer to [Integrating Univer Pro Features](/guides/sheets/getting-started/quickstart#integration-advanced-features).
- For server-side deployment, have completed Docker or Kubernetes environment configuration. If you haven't completed the configuration, please refer to [Docker Deployment Documentation](/guides/sheets/pro-features/server/docker) or [Kubernetes Deployment Documentation](/guides/sheets/pro-features/server/kubernetes).
- Have a valid license. If you don't have one yet, you can obtain it by registering on the [License Page](https://univer.ai/pro/license).

## Download License
1. Visit the [License Page](https://univer.ai/pro/license) and log in to your account

## Add or Update License

Unzip the downloaded license file `license-univer.zip`, you will get `license.txt` and `licenseKey.txt` files. Please keep these two files safe and ensure that you do not modify their format and content.

### Using License in JavaScript/TypeScript Projects
1. In addition to importing the univer plugin in your project, also import the license plugin. For specific plugin import methods, please refer to [here](https://univer.ai/guides/sheet/getting-started/installation#usage).

```typescript
import { UniverLicensePlugin } from '@univerjs-pro/license';
```

2. Register the `UniverLicensePlugin` plugin. Make sure this plugin is registered first after the univer instance is initialized. Then paste the content of the `license.txt` file into the license parameter of the plugin.

```typescript {2-4}
const univer = new Univer(/** omitted */);
univer.registerPlugin(UniverLicensePlugin, {
    license: `Content of your license.txt file`
});
```

### Using License with Univer Server

<Tabs items={['docker-compose', 'Kubernetes']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        1. Copy the `license.txt` and `licenseKey.txt` files to the `/docker-compose/configs/` directory.
        2. Run the service script `bash run.sh` in the docker-compose directory to restart the universer service.
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        1. Execute the following command
```bash
helm upgrade --install -n univer --create-namespace \
    --set global.istioNamespace="univer" \
    --set-file universer.license.licenseV2=$(YOUR_LICENSE_TXT_PATH) \
    --set-file universer.license.licenseKeyV2=$(YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_TXT_PATH) \
    univer-stack oci://univer-acr-registry.cn-shenzhen.cr.aliyuncs.com/helm-charts/univer-stack
```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify License

### Verifying License in JavaScript/TypeScript Projects
1. After injecting the License into the frontend and starting the project, you can verify whether the License is valid and being used correctly.
Note: If no license is entered, or if the entered license is invalid (e.g., expired or incorrect content), some features will be restricted, and a watermark will be displayed on the page.

2. With a valid license entered, the project will run normally without restrictions.

### Verifying License in Univer Server

1. Visit `host:8000/universer-api/license/key` to view the license entitlement information. For example: If your service is running locally, please visit `http://localhost:8000/universer-api/license/key`.

```json
{
    "verify":"true", // License verification result
    "release_type":"COMMERCIAL" // License type
}
```

## Common Issues

1. If license verification fails, please check:
   - Whether the license files are complete and unmodified
   - Whether the license has expired
   - Whether the service has been correctly restarted
2. For other issues, please contact our technical support
