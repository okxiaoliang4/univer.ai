# Introduction to Pro Features

Univer's core framework and many basic features are [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/dream-num/univer), and are licensed under the Apache-2.0 license for free use by individuals and organizations. At the same time, we provide a series of pro features for enterprise users, including: 

- Pivot Table
- Print
- Import and Export
- Collaborative Editing (including collaborative cursors and history)
- Live Share

and so on, these features will be marked with <span className="mr-2"><TitleTag /></span> in the documentation.

Pro features are based on the Univer commercial license agreement, which can be used for free, but there are some restrictions. If you need to unlock restrictions, you can contact our sales team to purchase a license. You can learn whether you need a license, how to obtain and use a license in the [License](/guides/sheets/pro-features/license) chapter.

## Univer Server

Some pro features require access to the Univer server, including:

- Import and Export
- Collaborative Editing
- Live Share

Please refer to [Service Overview](/guides/sheets/pro-features/server/overview).
