## FAQ

### Why can't I use the right-click context menu paste in Firefox?

Firefox does not yet support `clipboard.readText()`, as mentioned in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/readText). In this case, Univer can only retrieve clipboard content from native paste events, which means it can only support paste through keyboard shortcuts.

### I am using Chrome, but I can't paste using the right-click context menu?

First, make sure your browser version is 66 or higher, and then ensure that your website is accessed via HTTPS. Due to Chrome's security policy, the `clipboard` API can only be used under the HTTPS protocol.

### Why can't I copy and paste?

In browsers such as Chrome and Safari that support `clipboard.readText()`, Univer will attempt to directly access the clipboard content. Please make sure that the user performing the operation has granted Univer browser clipboard permissions.
