# Introduction to Univer Sheet

Welcome to the Univer Sheet documentation!

## What is Univer Sheet?

Univer is a full-stack framework to build productivity applications, and Univer Sheet is the spreadsheet component of Univer. 

Univer Sheet can both run in the browser and on the server (Node.js). It is designed to be highly flexible, extensible and customizable, and can be used to build a wide range of applications, from simple calculators to complex financial models.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a team, Univer Sheet can help you build powerful spreadsheet-based applications quickly and easily.

## How to Use These Docs

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case. You can also checkout Univer Docs at the top of the sidebar.

On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).

To get started, check out the [Quick Start](/guides/sheets/getting-started/quickstart) guide.

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Although our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on Univer.

To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and its ecosystem. 

If you are interested in running Univer on Node.js, you should also have a basic understanding of Node.js. 

If you would like to try Pro Features and deploy Univer Server, we recommend that you have a basic understanding of Linux, Docker and Docker Compose (or Kubernetes).

## Checkout Pro Features

We provide a series of pro features for enterprise users, including: 

- **Pivot Tables**
- **Print**
- **Import & Export**
- **Collaboration & Sharing**
- and more...

These features will be marked with <span className="mr-2"><TitleTag /></span> in the documentation.

Pro features are based on the Univer commercial license agreement, which can be used for free, but there are some restrictions. You can checkout [Introduction to Pro Features](/guides/sheets/pro-features/introduction) for more details.

## Extend Univer Sheet

Univer is designed to be highly extensible so you can shape it to fit your needs. We recommend that you read the [Architecture](/introduction/architecture/univer) section to understand how Univer Sheet is structured and how you can extend it. [How to write a CSV import plugin](http://localhost:3000/en-US/guides/sheets/tutorials/csv-import-plugin) is also a good starting point.
