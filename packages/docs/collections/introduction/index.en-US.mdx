Additionally, for some pro features aimed at enterprises and organizations (such as collaborative editing, live sharing, import & export, printing, etc.), we offer corresponding npm packages and backend services. These features are closed-source but are also available for free commercial use.

For enterprises with higher demands, Univer offers business upgrade subscriptions. This service provides more pro features and support for users with special requirements.
